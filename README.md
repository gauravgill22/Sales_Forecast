## Predictive Analytics for Restaurants

### Scope of Project

The restaurant sector is well-known for its slim profit margins, often resulting in a meager 5% of total revenue as net profit. Out of every $1.00 earned, roughly $0.30 - $0.35 is allocated to cover the costs of goods (such as raw materials, dry goods, and alcohol), while an additional $0.30 - $0.35 is directed toward labor expenses. This leaves approximately $0.30 - $0.40 to handle overhead costs (including rent, insurance, utilities, equipment rentals, waste management, accounting, and marketing), and potentially generate a return on investment, if there's any surplus after covering all expenditures.

An accurate sales forecast offers various opportunities for cost reduction and revenue enhancement in the restaurant industry:



* **Optimized Workforce Management** | Efficiently allocate labor hours by reducing staffing during slow nights and ensuring adequate staffing levels during busier periods.
* **Reduced Food Waste** | Implement precise daily preparation levels to minimize food wastage.
* **Streamlined Inventory Management ** | Managing inventory efficiently is crucial for cash flow, and maintaining optimal levels of fresh goods can prevent spoilage and food wastage.
* **Marketing Initiatives** | Maximize the impact of marketing budgets by focusing efforts on slow nights and weeks.

This pilot project, based on sales data from a two-star restaurant in Brooklyn, NY, aims to explore the development of an end-to-end restaurant sales forecasting tool using machine learning.

Predictions will be generated for upcoming nightly and weekly sales trends.
